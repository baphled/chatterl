<h3><a name="Description">Description</a></h3><p>
A multi processed chat system that can be housed over a number of nodes &amp; track clients over varying devices, at the time of the writing the system works over multiple nodes &amp; is able to do the basics (connect to a group, send message to other clients &amp; connected groups).</p>

<p>The main focus of this project is to create a chat system that is highly reliable as well as scaleable. Other developers will be able to create add-on modules that are able to interact with chatterl &amp; further enhance the functionality of chatterl &amp; the chatterl clients experience.</p>

<h3><a name="Useage">Useage</a></h3>
<p>At the moment of this writing there are two ways to interact with Chatterl, through a Erlang shell or via CWIGA, which gives you the ability to interact with Chatterl via a RESTful API.</p>
